1. "main.py": This is the entry point of the application. It will import and use the Tkinter app from "app.py". It will also use constants from "constants.py" and utility functions from "utils.py".

2. "app.py": This file will contain the main application class. It will use the UI elements from "ui.py", the API integration functions from "api_integration.py", and the image generation functions from "image_generator.py". It will also use constants from "constants.py" and utility functions from "utils.py".

3. "api_integration.py": This file will contain functions for interacting with the AI image generation REST API. It will use constants from "constants.py" and utility functions from "utils.py".

4. "ui.py": This file will contain the UI elements of the application. It will use constants from "constants.py" and utility functions from "utils.py".

5. "image_generator.py": This file will contain functions for generating images using the Stable Diffusion algorithm. It will use constants from "constants.py" and utility functions from "utils.py".

6. "constants.py": This file will contain constant values that are used across the application. It will be imported by all other files.

7. "utils.py": This file will contain utility functions that are used across the application. It will be imported by all other files.

Shared Dependencies:

- "APP_TITLE", "API_URL", "API_KEY": These are constants that will be defined in "constants.py" and used across the application.
- "generate_image", "get_api_response": These are function names that will be defined in "image_generator.py" and "api_integration.py" respectively and used in "app.py".
- "MainApp": This is the main application class that will be defined in "app.py" and used in "main.py".
- "MainWindow", "ControlPanel", "ImageViewer": These are UI element classes that will be defined in "ui.py" and used in "app.py".
- "format_error_message", "save_image": These are utility function names that will be defined in "utils.py" and used across the application.
